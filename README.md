## 🛡️ Mission
The **Global Cyber Threat Monitor** is a centralized "Powerhouse" dashboard designed for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts. It aggregates live threat maps, provides real-time telemetry simulations, and utilizes Google Gemini AI to offer actionable remediation strategies and threat analysis.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Unified Threat Map Hub
